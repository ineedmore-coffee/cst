*GoatCounter is an open source web analytics platform available as a free donation-supported hosted service or self-hosted app. It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as an alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo.*

GoatCounter is currently the analytics solution I use on all of my websites, as it's simple, free for small websites, lightweight, and privacy-respecting. It allows me to see if people are actually viewing my site or if I'm speaking into the eternal void.
