*Flatpak, formerly known as xdg-app, is a utility for software deployment and package management for Linux. It is advertised as offering a sandbox environment in which users can run application software in isolation from the rest of the system.*

I try to centralize around Flatpak as much as possible on my Linux systems, especially since my main laptop runs Fedora Silverblue.
