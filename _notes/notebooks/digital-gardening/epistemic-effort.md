Epistemic effort is an epistemic disclosure that describes how much effort I've put into the research of a given note's content. This gives the reader context as to whether this is a thought that I just had and put out there, or if it's a carefully crafted opinion based on hours of reading articles and papers (knowing me, it's almost always the former). 

A statement of epistemic effort, alongside it's companion [[epistemic status]] lowers the pressure on me to only put things out there that I've put hefty effort into, as while it's important to produce well crafted "final products", as I attempt to do on [*I Need More Coffee*](https://ineedmore.coffee), it's also important to [[learn in public]]. The need for perfect effort towards everything put out creates a barrier to publishing, and results in ideas languishing in a "drafts" folder rather than being slowly grown and developed.
