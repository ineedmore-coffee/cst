## What is an HTML Essay?

A single page website, usually hosted on a dedicated domain or subdomain, that serves to publish a single essay. This page may heavily use rich media, diagrams, charts, or even interactive JavaScript elements, but it is an essay first and foremost, built purposefully for a narrow scope of information delivery.

### Starting Points for Layout

[tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) — A CSS template for creating pages that look like statistician [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)'s handout style. A great starting point for those who want their essay to have a typeset look.

[latex.css](https://latex.vercel.app/) — A CSS template for creating pages that look like a LaTeX document. Definitely a great idea for anything math related, as it has built-in support for theorems, definitions, proofs, lemmas, and more.

[Referi](https://referi.ineedmore.coffee/) — A great starting point for those who want a minimal, yet robust way to create a lightweight webpage. It features an 8-column grid system that allows content to be laid out with `<cell>` tags.

[Raster Simple Grid System](https://rsms.me/raster/) — A grid system similar to [referi](https://referi.ineedmore.coffee/), but a bit more fleshed-out and focused a bit more on visual aesthetic and less on minimal resource usage. Built by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/), the same guy that made the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) typeface.

Remember that with any of these starting points, just changing the font and colors is enough to give it an all new visual identity, so don't feel trapped into a particular style just because you picked a certain CSS template to start with. For example, my professional site (as of August 2023) is actually based on [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), but you wouldn't think it. A majority of what I did was simply changing the colorscheme, and changing the font from [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/) to [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).
