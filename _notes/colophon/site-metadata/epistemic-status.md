Epistemic status describes the state of my confidence in the thoughts and opinions I'm expressing. As with it's companion [[epistemic effort]], it's a tool for overcoming mental barriers towards publishing content in the internet, lowering the pressure on me to only put things out there that I have an unrealistic amount of confidence in. While it's important to produce well crafted "final products", as I attempt to do on [*I Need More Coffee*](https://ineedmore.coffee), it's also important to [[learn in public]].
