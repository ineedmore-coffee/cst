id: napkins
note-status: warm-brewing
epistemic-status: Moderately confident in my own experiences, but I don't know that everyone should ditch their sketchbooks and start diagramming on napkins.
epistemic-effort: Low, I'm basing my thoughts on my own experiences rather than any reading supporting my claims here.

I draw on napkins a lot. It started as a natural consequence of what my workflow during this past summer has been, as I've been posting up in coffee shops and often carry only a small backpack (meaning my [[legal pad]] stayed home). As a result, I started jotting down notes on napkins.

As I continued doing this, however, I realized that the napkin represents a unique medium for thought. They're informal and not as meaningful as writing on paper or in a notebook, but demand some level of refinement due to how difficult it is to write on them. Focus is needed when drawing on a napkin and make deliberate strokes, it can't merely be lazy chickenscratch like what I often find myself writing in my legal pad.This creates a unique environment where I both find myself actually putting thoughts down, unlike notebooks that can feel intimidating, but forces me to form my thoughts deliberately enough that the end product is actually useful.

As a result, when determining what the [[visual style | site-design]] of this site would look like, I chose to use my napkin drawings as a major visual element. I personally love when authors use visuals to convey their thought process, in particular I'm a huge fan of how [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) [uses extraordinary visuals to explain very complex concepts](https://maggieappleton.com/drawinginvisibles1), and maintains a very consistent theme of visualizing things across her site. While I'm no illustrator, and certainly don't have the same capability to express my thoughts in very cohesive and clean visuals, I still do work through my mental process visually and spatially on napkins, and I think they provide insight into my mind that text alone cannot provide.
