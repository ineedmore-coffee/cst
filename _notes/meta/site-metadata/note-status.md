Note statuses are my way of designating how finished a note is. This enables [[learn in public|learning in public]], by removing the need for everything to be 100% done before publishing it. Many digital gardens use, well, horticultural terminology, such as the [growth stages on Maggie Appleton's site](https://maggieappleton.com/colophon), but given that this is the "Coffee Shop Table", I've opted for coffee-based terms instead

Most notes will go through the following pipeline:

* They start as [[grounds]], an idea or topic that I want to write about but that I have yet to dive into.
* If it's a note that I'm working on in a short timeframe, it's considered [[warm brewing]]. If it's a note that will be revised over a longer timeframe, it's [[cold brewing]].
    * If a note becomes irrelevant during the brewing process, or there is some other reason that it will definitely never be finished, it becomes [[overextracted]].
* When the note is completed to a reasonable extent (it doesn't need to be never edited again), it's now [[brewed]] and ready for consumption!
