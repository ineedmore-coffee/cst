An "overextracted" note is a note that was left to brew for too long, and as a result is no longer suitable for consumtion. **It designates unfinished notes that I don't intend to finish**, either because it's about something I'm no longer interested in, or because a context change of some variety has made the thought no longer correct or pertinent.
