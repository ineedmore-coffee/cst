A note in the "grounds" stage is **an idea that is just forming**, a seed or a spark that can build into something greater. Most notes start out as grounds, before getting slowly brewed in my mind over the course of days (see [[warm-brewing]]), weeks, or even months (see [[cold-brewing]]).

To see the other statuses notes can have, visit [[note-status]].
